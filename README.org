#+title: Emacs Config
#+author: Jackson Ray Hamilton

Contained here is a "starter config" that:

- Fixes up some of the "questionable" defaults in Emacs, and...
- Equips users with some really powerful tools for working on software projects!

Install the latest Emacs and give it a try!  Save the file "init.el" to a directory in your home called: =~/.emacs.d/=.  Then launch the Emacs app.

You can read my complete guide to this config in: "Guide.org"

You can also learn about how I got started on my own Emacs journey in: "Backstory.org"

Enjoy!
