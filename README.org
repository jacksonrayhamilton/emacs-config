#+title: Emacs Config
#+author: Jackson Ray Hamilton

Contained here is a "starter config" that:

- Fixes up some of the "questionable" defaults in Emacs, and...
- Equips users with some really powerful tools for working on software projects!

Install the latest Emacs and give it a try!  Copy "init.el" and the "Snippets" directory to a directory in your home called: =~/.emacs.d/=.  Also run the included scripts to install all the necessary dependencies:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  emacs --script install-packages.el
  emacs --script install-grammars.el
#+END_SRC

Then launch the Emacs app.

You can read my complete guide to this config in: "Guide.org"

You can also learn about how I got started on my own Emacs journey in: "Backstory.org"

Enjoy!
